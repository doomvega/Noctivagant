        <h1>Socials</h1>
        <div class="sub"><p>Here's where you can find me!</p></div>

        <h2>Important:</h2>
        <p><a href="https://discord.gg/7SPVYjMx5m">Discord</a>: this is the link to the OFFICIAL Doomvega Discord server. You must be eighteen or older to join. You'll get stream notifications from me and my buddies when we go live, and you can suggest stuff to us, hang out with like-minded people, all that jazz. Come check it out!</p>
        <p>My offical email is doomvega at noctivagant dot net. Use this to contact me about errors with the site, or serious inquiries regarding my work as an artist or musician. As Wayner put it, "misuse of this information will result in your absolute banning".</p>

        <h2>Videos:</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/doomvega">Twitch</a>: where the livestreams happen. We go live on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays around 8:00 PM EST. I post my streaming schedule on most of my socials (hooked up to PostyBirb) and in our Discord. You can also check our schedule from the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/doomvega/schedule">dedicated schedule tab on Twitch.</a></p>
        <p><a href="https://makertube.net/c/doomvxga/videos">MakerTube</a>: where all my future videos will be going. I love how intuitive MakerTube is. Can't wait to really dive in!</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DOOMVXGA">YouTube</a>: my current YouTube account, which is linked to my music and all my future releases.</p>

        <h2>Writing & Art:</h2>
        <p><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/doomvega">Archive of Our Own</a>: I don't post here very often but I will be using AO3 as a way to store original (as well as fan) works.</p>

        <h2>The Posts:</h2>
        <p><a href="https://noctivagant.net/blog">DOOMVEGA's Poasts</a>: after a couple of years, <b>Noctivagant has a blog again.</b> I don't know what I'll be doing with this blog, but it's nice to have. You can subscribe to the <a href="https://noctivagant.net/RSS/feed.xml">RSS feed</a> if you'd like. There's a fancy button for it on our <a href="/links/wall">links</a> page, in the "Link to Me" section.</p>
        <p><a href="https://doomvega.bearblog.dev/">BearBlog</a>: I'll be putting all of my "effortposts" onto my new BearBlog! I really like this site so far, and it has RSS so you can keep up with our posts there. This is exactly what I want out of a blogging platform!</p>
        <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/noctivagant.net">Bluesky</a>: Surprisingly, Bluesky is a very pleasant space to be. I'll be sharing my art and streaming schedule here. Hooked up to <a href="https://www.postybirb.com/">PostyBirb</a>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/doomvega">Pillowfort</a>: Pillowfort is another place to catch some art and cool things I found that I tossed in my queue. Hooked up to <a href="https://www.postybirb.com/">PostyBirb</a>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://mastoart.social/@doomvega">Mastoart</a>: this is my new Masto account. I felt that Mastoart was a better fit for me and what I post. Hooked up to <a href="https://www.postybirb.com/">PostyBirb</a>.</p>

        <h2>Support Me:</h2>
        <p><a href="https://ko-fi.com/doomvxga">Ko-Fi</a>: this is where I currently take donations and commissions and host the majority of my art. It also acts as my digital storefront, hosting all sorts of handmade jewelry and digital adoptable characters. Hooked up to <a href="https://www.postybirb.com/">PostyBirb</a>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://doomvega.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>: this is where I sell all of my music. Itching for some new sounds? Come check out my Bandcamp. All of my latest releases will go up there.</p>
        <p><a href="https://streamlabs.com/doomvega/merch">StreamLabs</a>: my StreamLabs merch store. If you buy any of this stuff on stream you'll get a special alert!</p>
        <p><a href="https://doomvega.itch.io/">Itch.io</a>: I'll be putting my Godot experiments over here, as well as my musicâ€” just in case.</p>

        <h2>Moving Away and Retired:</h2>
        <p>I have officially moved on from many sites. If you see anyone posting anywhere else under my screen name, that is likely not me. Report and ignore them.</p>
