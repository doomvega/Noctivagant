                <h1>Socials</h1>
                <p>So, where else do I exist on the Internet? Where can you support me and my work? It's all listed here. Drop me a follow on your platforms of choice! It's always appreciated, but never required. All of my social profiles, including my Discord server, are <b>18+ only</b>, no exceptions.</p>
                
                <p>I use <a href="https://www.postybirb.com/">PostyBirb</a> to post to multiple websites at once.</p>
                
                <h2>Discord</h2>
                <p>We have a Discord server! If you're interested in what I do, want to meet other folks in the community, or just need a space to hang out and meet other creative folks, hop in. You can also opt-in to my stream and video notifications, so you'll never miss when I go live or upload a new clip.</p>
                <p><a href="https://discord.gg/7SPVYjMx5m">Join the Discord!</a> We can't wait to see you there!</p>
                
                <h2>Streaming</h2>
                <p>My main presence on the Internet right now is through my livestreams! I stream all sorts of things, from games to art to programming and more. Stream schedules get posted to my socials and to my Discord server every week.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/doomvega">Twitch</a>: where all the livestreams happen. Twitch is the best place to catch me if I'm live.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://makertube.net/c/doomvxga/videos">MakerTube</a>: an alternative to YouTube, and another place to catch my streams. MakerTube chat is integrated with OBS, so no need to be on two websites at once to interact with the stream!</li>

                </ul>
                
                <h2>Writing, Art, and Development</h2>
                <p>I'm a multi-media artist, so it can be difficult to put all of my work in a single gallery. Here's where you can find all styles of my work.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/doomvega">AO3</a>: I enjoy fics from time to time. Come read some things I've written!</li>

                </ul>
                
                <h2>Blogging and Posting</h2>
                <p>On occasion, I make silly posts on the Internet. This is where you can find these posts.</p>

                <h2>Music</h2>
                <p>Here's all the places you can find my music. Streaming my music doesn't support me as directly as purchasing my music does.</p>
