        <h1>Twitch</h1>
        <div class="sub"><p>some important information regarding my Twitch channel.</p></div>
        <p>I wanted a space to go more in-depth with the rules around my Twitch channel, and explain stuff like ads.</p>
        <p><i>Please do not sub, give me bits, or donate to my Twitch channel if you are in a tight financial situation.</i> I don't want to cause strain on anyone. Subs, bits, donations, and other forms of monetary support are never, ever required but deeply appreciated.</p>
        <p>All prices here are in USD. They are not in PokeDollars. :]</p>
        <h2>Rules:</h2>
        <ol>
        <li><b>My streams are for 18+ (ADULT) audiences. The mature tag on my streams is there for a reason.</b> That reason being, I have absolutely <i>zero desire</i> to interact with random children or high schoolers. If you are found breaking this rule, you will be <i>instantly banned.</i> (Specifically, if you are underage and you follow me, that is grounds for banning.)</li>
        <li><b>Bigotry will not be tolerated. Racism, queerphobia, etc. is NOT cool.</b> Firstly, don't waste my time. Secondly, I will not stand for bigotry of any kind. Your hatred has no place here. You will be banned and reported. It's 2024. We should not have to have this conversation.</li>
        <li><b>Don't be weird towards your streamer. I'm here to have fun. Think before you speak.</b> I'm not going to be an expert at everything. I play games and make art for fun, and I do not appreciate folks coming in specifically to harass, compare, or judge me and/or my abilities.</li>
        <li><b>Do not backseat. It ruins the experience for everyone.</b> If you are unaware of what backseating is, <a href="https://webtribunal.net/blog/what-is-backseat-gaming">this is a great (short) article on backseating.</a> Basically, if I'm playing a game, I want to experience it for myself. I don't need help from the audience, no matter how well-meaning you may be.</li>
        <li><b>If you were banned, it was likely for good reason. Bans are permanent and final.</b> This is self-explanitory. Break any of these rules and you will be banned.</li>
        <li><b>Have fun!</b> I know I'm a bit of a hardass with all these rules but I promise that 99% of the time, I'm a chill guy. Just don't be a jackass or shitstirrer on my streams, and we can all have a good time.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Advertisements:</h2>
        <p>Yes, I run three minutes of ads on my streams every hour. This allows me to make a little bit of money doing something I love. I don't enjoy running ads, so here is what you can do when the ads hit.</p>
        <p><b>Get up and stay away from your machine.</b> When the ads start rolling, I will drop whatever I'm doing and cut to BRB. You should take this time to get up, get yourself a snack or some water, and move around. The stream will (likely) be here when you get back.</p>
        <p><b>Subscribers do not have to watch ads.</b> You get access to some cool emotes, and it helps keep me afloat!</p>
        <p><b>DO NOT:</b> mute the stream, close, or minimize the tab. You <i>can</i> mute the tab, but muting the stream directly, for whatever reason, <b>does not count as a view!</b></p>
        <p>When I get out of the situation I'm in, I plan to take a small portion of each paycheck to turn into gift subs. If and when the stream revenue picks up, that will go right back to the community, too.</p>
        <h2>Other:</h2>
        <p>There are some other quirks of the stream I wanted to go over very quickly.</p>
        <p>Firstly, <b>I am stuck in a tense living situation.</b> I stream when I am most comfortable, or alone in the house. Sometimes streams may end early or be disrupted because of this. I am actively looking for a new place!</p>
        <p>Secondly, <b>chat is followers-only to protect myself and the community.</b> Similar to the first rule, I'm not keen on strangers popping in, saying whatever they want, and leaving. However, if jerks come in anyway, I can lock down chat and nip things in the bud.</p>
        <p>Third, <b>Twitch only pays me when I make $50 or more.</b> That's twenty subsâ€” I get half of all subs, so that's ~$2.50 for me. 2.5 * 20 = 50. There's more that you can do to help me reach payout, like tipping me through StreamLabs, throwing me bits, or gifting subs if you're feeling generous!</p>
