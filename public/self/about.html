        <h1>About DOOMVEGA</h1>
        <p>Howdy! As I said before, I'm DOOMVEGA. Most people call me Vega, but I have three names total, the other two being Atlas and Jupi, short for Jupiter. I am a transmasc and queer multi-media artist making cool things on the internet. I don't like to make my identity the center of what I do, but it certainly plays a part in that.</p>
        
        <h2>So, what can you call me?</h2>
        <p>Whichever of my three names you want! Atlas was the first name I picked out when I realized I was trans, with Vega coming after I played DOOM for the very first time, and Jupiter following soon after. I <i>almost</i> took Mars, but that seemed antithetical to Vega.</p>
        <p>I don't really mind how you refer to me pronouns-wise, just mix it up (this includes neos)! I don't use she/her, though. Ribbons does!</p>
        
        <h2>What do I do?</h2>
        <p>I make a little bit of everything. Generally, I make...</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Music</li>
        <li>Digital art</li>
        <li>Videos</li>
        <li>Video games</li>
        <li>Fanfiction & original writing</li>
        <li>Small programs</li>
        <li>Websites just like this one!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>...and I'm always trying new things! I dabble in sewing, pin-making, and bullet journalling.</p>
        
        <h2>Anything else?</h2>
        <p>Nope, that's it for now. If you're here looking for dirt, drama, or opinions that do not align with yours, you're looking in the wrong place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">Go home?</a></p>
