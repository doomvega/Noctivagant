        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <p>I've been chipping away at <i>The Body Keeps the Score</i> by Bessel van der Kolk. It's a very difficult read for me; it makes me so incredibly sad every time I pick it up. The tradeoff is I walk away knowing myself and my experiences a little bit better.</p>
        <p>I'm learning Java with <i>Teach Yourself Java in 24 Hours</i> by Rogers Cadenhead. Java is neat, and I appreciate Cadenhead's approach at teaching it. It's very fun.</p>
        <p>I've also been enjoying <i>Rise of the Videogame Zinesters</i> by Anna Anthropy, which is a short read at only 162 pages (not counting the appendixes, notes, references, and indexâ€” those take the book up to about 200 pages). I'm halfway through and yearning to finish up one of my games, for the sake of making a game.</p>
        
        <h2>Watching</h2>
        <p>I'm still not into TV, but I'm also once again making the yearly "divorce from YouTube", so I'm back to watching things on <i>Dropout</i>. I really enjoyed <i>Nobody Asked</i>, which is fantastically <i>Mythbusters</i>-like. I've also been enjoying <i>Dirty Laundry</i> and realizing that wow, my life is boring.</p>
        <p>As for livestreams, I'll sit down with a Vinny or Joel VOD once in a while. I'm getting better and better at moving away from YouTube, though, so my VOD-watching has decreased. I have been able to catch them live more often, which I think is a fantastic tradeoff.</p>
        
        <h2>Playing</h2>
        <p>It took a while, but <i>Balatro</i> has finally consumed me. Finally. I'm not particularly <i>good</i> at it. As Joel said, "I am playing this game like an ape". It's taking me a little while to figure out what Jokers work well together, how to prune my deck, how to tip the scales in my favor even though the game is partially randomized. I'm learning a lot from RTGame's playthroughs. It's been a lot of fun so far.</p>
        <p>I've also gotten back into <i>Rollercoaster Tycoon 3</i>, but instead of making my own parks, I'm finally going through the scenarios and taking them on one-by-one. I'm pretty sure this was the original intent of the <i>Rollercoaster Tycoon</i> games. I seriously wouldn't know, because I played nothing but the sandbox mode growing up. It's a nice change of pace. Everything feels very deliberate and I have to strategize to stay afloat. I like it.</p>
        
        <h2>Music-Making</h2>
        <p>I have an outline of an album ready. This isn't really big huge news, but it's been good to sit with the tracks and arrange them in a way that makes sense thematically. I have to go in and try to mix and master them by hand before I'll be ready to even consider releasing them.</p>
        <p>The soundtrack for my Minecraft mod is done! Now to just finish making the mod that goes with it, and I'll be all set to release it! I really am very excited to release it, this music is some of the best I've made in a little while. (My favorite is the custom disk!)</p>
        <p>I've put the <i>DOOM</i> album on hold in lieu of these two projects. I can always play with SC-55 later.</p>
        
        <h2>Developing</h2>
        <p>I'm still chipping away at Java. I've reached a point in my Java book where it's taking much more effort to understand what the hell's going on. It started with multithreading, and since then it's been difficult to keep up with each chapter in a timely manner. However, I am making progress. It's just taking more time than I would have liked.</p>
        <p>As for webdev, I've picked up some new tricks to make everything easier for myself. I learned how to make elements of a webpage static with JavaScript, meaning I write them once in a JS file and they update automatically across the site. This is such a gamechanger for me, especially since Noctivagant is my biggest site so far and it can be difficult to update every page one-by-one.</p>
        <p>My games are still cooking. They're taking a very long time, I know. I am working on them a little bit each day when I can. I recently laid out all my ideas for <i>HEAVENSPEAK</i> to help with the drafting process, and I made a friend who's willing to help out on <i>PRISM</i>. Games take time to make, so I'm trying to stay patient with myself and handle it as well as I can.</p>
        
        <h2>Sketching & Painting</h2>
        <p>My drawing tablet of eight years suddenly crapped out on me following a Windows security update, so I got a new tablet for Christmas. It's much bigger, has much better control, and I feel more comfortable making things with it. I got some new Krita brushes to celebrate the occasion, and even started tinkering with my own brushes.</p>
        <p>I've also been Shading and Poisoning my art. This is something I talk about over on <a href="https://artistsresource.neocities.org/">the Digital Artist's Resource</a>, and I had to perform an emergency GPU upgrade on my PC in order to do it. Along with these measures, I've been signing and dating my art, to better archive it later. My art feels <i>better</i> now, even though I'm not necessarily doing anything differently.</p>
        
        <h2>And Everything In-Between</h2>
        <p>I recently reinstalled Blender, which means that once I'm able, I'll be tinkering with 3D models. It's a good skill to have as an artist and a game developer, and it opens up a lot of opportunities for me. Blender is fantastically complicated, but I think with enough time and dedication I can get to a point with it that feels comfortable.</p>
