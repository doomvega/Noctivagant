        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <p>I'm learning Java with <i>Teach Yourself Java in 24 Hours</i> by Rogers Cadenhead. Java is neat, and I appreciate Cadenhead's approach at teaching it. It's very fun.</p>
        
        <h2>Watching</h2>
        <p>I've finished all the <i>Dropout</i> shows I like. Now I'm waiting for more <i>Make Some Noise</i> and <i>Game Changer</i>. I'm so excited for season seven!</p>
        <p>As for livestreams, I'll sit down with a Vinny or Joel VOD once in a while. I'm getting better and better at moving away from YouTube, though, so my VOD-watching has decreased. I have been able to catch them live more often, which I think is a fantastic tradeoff.</p>
        
        <h2>Playing</h2>
        <p>It took a while, but <i>Balatro</i> has finally consumed me. Finally. I'm not particularly <i>good</i> at it. As Joel said, "I am playing this game like an ape". It's taking me a little while to figure out what Jokers work well together, how to prune my deck, how to tip the scales in my favor even though the game is partially randomized. I'm learning a lot from RTGame's playthroughs. It's been a lot of fun so far.</p>
        <p>I've also gotten back into <i>Rollercoaster Tycoon 3</i>, but instead of making my own parks, I'm finally going through the scenarios and taking them on one-by-one. I'm pretty sure this was the original intent of the <i>Rollercoaster Tycoon</i> games. I seriously wouldn't know, because I played nothing but the sandbox mode growing up. It's a nice change of pace. Everything feels very deliberate and I have to strategize to stay afloat. I like it.</p>
        
        <h2>Music-Making</h2>
        <p>I have an outline of an album ready. This isn't really big huge news, but it's been good to sit with the tracks and arrange them in a way that makes sense thematically. I have to go in and try to mix and master them by hand before I'll be ready to even consider releasing them.</p>
        <p>The soundtrack for my Minecraft mod is done! Now to just finish making the mod that goes with it, and I'll be all set to release it! I really am very excited to release it, this music is some of the best I've made in a little while. (My favorite is the custom disk!)</p>
        <p>I've put the <i>DOOM</i> album on hold in lieu of these two projects. I can always play with SC-55 later.</p>
        
        <h2>Developing</h2>
        <p>I'm still chipping away at Java. I've reached a point in my Java book where it's taking much more effort to understand what the hell's going on. It started with multithreading, and since then it's been difficult to keep up with each chapter in a timely manner. However, I am making progress. It's just taking more time than I would have liked.</p>
        <p>After Java, I plan to tackle C#, as Godot uses C# as its alternate language (suppose you don't want to use GDScript). C# is also related to C++, which is (apparently) a requirement for many game development jobs. It's also in the same family as Java and Python, both of which I have a pretty decent understanding of.</p>
        <p>As for my games, they're <i>still</i> cooking! I started working on my platformer game after my Java practice, and I found that my understanding of the logic that went into programming had changedâ€” I had learned some new tricks! I was able to implement features that would have taken me a very long time to figure out even just a few months ago. I hope to keep up with the energy and passion. I <i>need</i> to release my games.</p>
        
        <h2>Sketching & Painting</h2>
        <p>My drawing tablet of eight years suddenly crapped out on me following a Windows security update, so I got a new tablet for Christmas. It's much bigger, has much better control, and I feel more comfortable making things with it. I got some new Krita brushes to celebrate the occasion, and even started tinkering with my own brushes.</p>
        <p>I've also been Shading and Poisoning my art. This is something I talk about over on <a href="https://artistsresource.neocities.org/">the Digital Artist's Resource</a>, and I had to perform an emergency GPU upgrade on my PC in order to do it. Along with these measures, I've been signing and dating my art, to better archive it later. My art feels <i>better</i> now, even though I'm not necessarily doing anything differently.</p>
        
        <h2>And Everything In-Between</h2>
        <p>I recently reinstalled Blender, which means that once I'm able, I'll be tinkering with 3D models. It's a good skill to have as an artist and a game developer, and it opens up a lot of opportunities for me. Blender is fantastically complicated, but I think with enough time and dedication I can get to a point with it that feels comfortable.</p>
