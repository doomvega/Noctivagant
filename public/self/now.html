                <h1>Now</h1>
                <p>This is a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">now page!</a> This is everything that I am doing right now.</p>
        
                <h2>Reading</h2>
                <p>I've been enjoying <i>Full Spectrum</i> by Adam Rogers. It's a fascinating look into the world of colors, and how humans harnessed the powers of color.</p>
        
                <h2>Watching</h2>
                <p>I've once again run out of Dropout to watch, so I'm rewatching <i>Game Changer</i> and <i>Make Some Noise</i>.</p>
                
                <h2>Playing</h2>
                <p>I'm getting back into <i>Sky: Children of the Light</i>. I'm really excited for the new season! Maybe I'll get the season pass...</p>
        
                <h2>Music-Making</h2>
                <p>My <i>DOOM</i> EP is nearly done. Since I made the switch to Linux, making music with FL Studio might be more complicated than usual, but the EP is under way.</p>
        
                <h2>Developing</h2>
                <p>I've been hard at work on the Noctivagant rewrite. I've also been studying Java in my spare time.</p>
        
                <h2>Art</h2>
                <p>I'm working on some big digital paintings, and seamless patterns. I found a cool brush that allows me to make fractals! I've really enjoyed making big seamless fractal designs. I might set those up in my Ko-Fi shop as a texture pack.</p>
