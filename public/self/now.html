        <div class="sub"><p>Everything that I am working on right now!</p></div>
        <p>This is a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">now page!</a> This is everything that I am doing right now. It might be neat to keep track of this. Last updated on Aug. 12th 2025.</p>
        
        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <p>I'm learning Java with <i>Teach Yourself Java in 24 Hours</i> by Rogers Cadenhead. Java is neat, and I appreciate Cadenhead's approach at teaching it. It's very fun.</p>
        
        <h2>Watching</h2>
        <p><i>Game Changer</i> season seven is out! It's been a blast so far and I'm really excited to see the rest of the season. I also picked up <i>Parlor Room</i> which has been very entertaining as well. It makes me wish I could play tabletop games with my friends, but alas!</p>
        <p>As always, I've been slowly adding to my Jellyfin server. The only downside to this is that my drive is now basically full-- meaning I need to go out and get myself a new drive very soon. But for now, I think I have enough on there to keep me entertained for a while.</p>
        <p>At my family's request, I watched <i>The Mummy</i> and <i>The Mummy Returns</i>, both of which were... bad, but highly entertaining, with the second movie being much, <i>much</i> worse than the first. But importantly, I had a great time watching them, and hopefully I can get those in Jellyfin very soon.</p>
        <p>I also watched all of the <i>Pirates of the Carribean</i> movies. I loved all of them except the fifth one. That one was, uh... interesting. I'll write up a full review later, maybe.</p>
        
        <h2>Playing</h2>
        <p>I've been bouncing between <i>Balatro</i>, <i>Sky</i>, and <i>Minecraft</i>. I've been enjoying all of them! I'm slowly unlocking Plasma in <i>Balatro</i>-- I already did this on mobile, so I really want to get the PC version, too. I'm doing daily quests in <i>Sky</i> and trying to participate in the seasonal stuff-- mind you, this is the first time I've done that in about three years! As for <i>Minecraft</i>, I'm just building things I think are neat, and trying to learn cool Redstone stuff.</p>
        
        <h2>Music-Making</h2>
        <p>It's been a little while, but an EP is happening! This is very exciting news considering my other music has hit some roadblocks. It's going to be very light and fun. I'm just letting myself do whatever I'd like while also trying to do something new.</p>
        
        <h2>Developing</h2>
        <p>My friend Epi and I just made a Markov chain Discord bot! We taught her some very basic words and she's able to string together a sentence. Right now she's not online, but I'll be able to host her very soon. I'm thinking of keeping her just to my servers for now.</p>
        
        <h2>Sketching & Painting</h2>
        <p><i>Krita</i> remains good to me, and my software of choice. While I haven't been explicitly focusing on improving my art or changing things up, I feel a lot better about my art currently. I still have a long way to go, but my confidence is up!</p>
        
        <h2>And Everything In-Between</h2>
        <p>I discovered VRoid Studio, which is a 3D modelling software for anime-style characters. It reminds me a lot of the Sims, so I've been having a lot of fun just playing around with it! I was able to make a VTuber avatar, though I'm sure I'll never use it. I was considering making some models and popping them up in my Ko-Fi shop!</p>
