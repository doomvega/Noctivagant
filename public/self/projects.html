        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <div class="sub"><p>The things I'm making.</p></div>

        <p>I classify myself as a multi-media artist, and I often have a lot of things going on at once. Here's a taste of my ongoing projects!</p>
        <h2>Websites:</h2>
        <p><a href="https://doomvega.art/">DOOMVEGA</a>: my professional site. It acts as a gallery and hosts my commission information. I plan on only displaying original works there.</p>
        <p><a href="https://testingrange.dev/">The Testing Range</a>: a site that hosts layouts for static websites, as well as information on how to make a website using Neocities or Nekoweb.</p>
        <p><a href="https://webmastery101.neocities.org/">Webmastery 101</a>: a site to teach new and potential webmasters all they need to know about webmastery and the indie net.</p>
        <p><a href="https://unionaerospace.net/">The UAC</a>: a fake website for the UAC from DOOM. I learned a lot while making this site and I poured a lot of love into it.</p>
        <p><a href="https://artistsresource.neocities.org/">The Digital Artist's Resource</a>: a website for artists of all kinds, hosting a manifesto, links to resources such as Glaze and Nightshade, and art-making programs like Krita and Blender.</p>

        <h2>Games:</h2>
        <p>PRISM: a cool platformer I've been toying with.</p>
        <p>Heavenspeak: a text-based adventure following Ribbons and her friends, Radiation, Lyre, and Timekeep as they attempt to bring a revolution to Heaven.</p>

        <h2>Webcomics:</h2>
        <p>None are public at the moment; I am focusing more on my development skills first. However, I do have some cooking. Keep an eye out!</p>

        <h2>Written Works:</h2>
        <p><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/49391746">Enter Heaven by Self-Violence</a>: an angel finds their charge standing in the center of Heaven. They are not supposed to be dead.</p>
        <p><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/45226012/chapters/113776504">Destiny Denied</a>: a crossover DOOM x PKMN fic following Flynn Taggart and Vega as they are forced to investigate a strange centuries-old prophecy for the UAC. The prophecy states that two entities with incredible abilities will rise to destroy the region of Tamor. The UAC has ordered the duo to find those entities and stop them. Little do they know, their enemies may be closer than they think.</p>

        <h2>Other:</h2>
        <p>Ribbons Bot (Twitch): a bot for my Twitch chat. She was created by <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/epiglottalaxolotl">EpiglottalAxolotl</a> and myself. She handles things on-stream for me. She has a ton of fun commands, plus some secret commands that haven't been discovered yet!</p>
