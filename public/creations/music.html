        <h2>Originals:</h2>
        <p>I write original music using a combination of FL Studio, Melodyne, Audacity, and sometimes GarageBand. My lastest releases are <a href="https://album.link/i/1699256687">Dedicated To</a> and <a href="https://song.link/i/1699147412">Stay</a>, both of which I highly encourage you purchase. I'm working on new music at the moment, so please be patient! You can see my setup and list of instruments <a href="/self/setup">here</a>.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to get in touch with me regarding my music, you can find my email on my <a href="/self/socials">socials</a> page. You can read more about my music on <a href="https://doomvega.art/music">my portfolio site.</a></p>

        <h2>Music Theory & Tools:</h2>
        <p>The first thing you need to know about theory is that none of it is necessarily right or wrong. Music theory is not the be-all, end-all of music. In fact, what we in the west call music theory doesn't even cover the kinds of music around the world. Theory is just one of many ways to communicate musical ideas. It's akin to studying the ins and outs of English as a native speaker. And, perhaps most importantly, you do not need to know music theory in order to make music— at least, not to the extent of other theorists. Follow your ear and make what sounds interesting to you.</p>
        <p>However, I am excited and honored to see more musicians, young and old, wanting to pick up theory. It is an incredibly powerful tool to help us understand what's happening behind the scenes of our favorite music. If you'd like to learn more, I have compiled an on-growing list of resources that I one hundred percent endorse.</p>
        <p>First, if you are still in school, I highly recommend that you look into music programs. If you're already part of a musical program, such as a guitar class, school choir, or concert/orchestral band, speak with your teachers or professors to see if there are any courses that dive into theory. If not, don't fear— there are plenty of resources online to help you learn. :)</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBcZM94cb2UxTkdSKuQG29S6wPaGJXpJq">Adam Neely's QnA.</a> Neely is a fantastic musician and he covers some really interesting and advanced topics in ways that non-theorists can understand. He also is part of a band called Sungazer, <a href="https://sungazermusic.bandcamp.com/">which has put out some bangers.</a></p>
        <p><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMvVESrbjBWqiFknEG7ZeTk69soXSvU2J">12Tone's "Understanding Music" series.</a> 12Tone is a musician who breaks down concepts in popular and well-known music, which is a pretty comfortable place to start. It also reveals some really interesting aspects of songs you may not have even noticed. He also provides isolated stems, sheet music, and funny visuals in his videos.</p>
        <p><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQY6PNl6p3MYg8OD6MYB2pKOFWUA_hCHN">Scruffy's "What I Love" series.</a> Scruffy is a musician who discusses very specific elements found in songs, mostly video game music. They also have a lot of videos on sound design, which can be eye-opening. My favorite video is their discussion of <a href="https://youtu.be/1yTIhtfgDwY">the sound design in Five Nights at Freddy's</a>, but all of what they make is super interesting and informative. They also have a <a href="https://scruffymusic.com/">website!</a></p>
        <p>Of course, getting your hands on an instrument will also help you understand theory. When discussing theory, especially online, people use a piano as their frame of reference, as pianos are pretty popular instruments, especially now in the age of DAWs and MIDI. Some powerful in-browser tools I use are <a href="https://www.beepbox.co/">Beepbox</a>, which is free and provides links for you to store your music forever (FOREVER!), <a href="https://melodle.yesmeno.com/">Melodle</a>, which is similar to Wordle but uses musical "words" instead of actual words, <a href="https://typatone.com/">Typatone</a>, which is a fun website that turns the sentences you write into music, and <a href="https://www.patatap.com/">Patatap (SEIZURE WARNING, FLASHING LIGHTS!)</a>, which is similar to using a MIDI controller. Each of these tools, especially Beepbox, is very cool and has aided me on my musical journey!</p>
        <p>As for full DAWs... I started out on GarageBand on my tiny little Apple phone. If you have an apple product, check to see if you have GarageBand. It comes free with your device and is a pretty good way to start making music. Now I use FL Studio, which is a bit pricy but worth the money. It has a bit of a learning curve, but once you get the grasp of what's going on, you can navigate FL like a pro.</p>
        <p>I use Audacity to apply weird effects to music and make cool mashups (though I do not recommend that you use Audacity to make mashups because you have to time everything perfectly— there's no "grid" for things to snap to). I also use it as a quick .wav to .mp3 converter, and the best part is that it is <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">completely free</a>.</p>
        <p>I also use Melodyne 5 to make the "GLaDOS" effect for vocals, and do musical modeswaps. This one is also a bit pricy but if you're very very into the details of music, it's a good investment. It can also be used as a plugin in FL!</p>
        <p>Also, <a href=" https://downloads.khinsider.com/">Khinsider</a> has a lot of video game music free to download!</p>
