                <h1>Thanks!</h1>
                <p>Here is everyone responsible for helping bring Noctivagant to life.</p>
                <p>Website layout based on <a href="https://sadgrl.online/" target="_blank">sadgrl.online</a>'s <a href="https://sadgrl.online/projects/layout-builder/">layout builder</a>. I used the layout it gave me for a very long time but finally crafted my own. Thank you so much, playing with that layout taught me so much of what I know about webdev now!</p>
                <p>Noctivagant is hosted and built on <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a> and its domain is provided by <a href="https://porkbun.com/">Porkbun</a>.</p>
                <p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tutorials from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>. You have no idea how many times I went to that site for answers.</p>
                <p>Cursor provided by <a href="https://www.cursors-4u.com">Cursors-4U</a>.</p>
                <p>All art for Noctivagant was created by myself in <a href="https://krita.org/">Krita</a> and <a href="https://www.aseprite.org/">Aseprite</a>.</p>
                <p>Thank you to all of you who have supported this project with curiosity, enthusiasm, and love. Thank you to every webmaster, every visitor, and every misclick. Noctivagant is a labor of love, of trials and errors, and patience.</p>
                <p>I am eternally grateful for you all and the resources you've provided. Thank you so much!</p>
