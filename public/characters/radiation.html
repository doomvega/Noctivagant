        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>Radiation was Forged eons ago, when humans were beginning to comprehend faith. As a Pillar of Divinity, he was made to intercept and "correct" attempts at human divination, as that was a job for holy beings only. His bosses told him to be swift and just with his correction, but he didn't feel that was the right thing to do. It's a miracle he hasn't lost his job.</p>
        <p>He has an apartment close to the Aether, where the archangels live and work. He's often invited to parties and has... connections.<p>
        <p>Radiation's life changed when he met Ribbons in front of a café. They hit it off instantly— Ribbons was much more of a talker— and they have been close friends ever since. She introduced him to "urbex", and they started exploring abandoned locations together. They soon met Lyre and Timekeep, and went exploring together. No one outside of their circle of friends knows what he gets up to.</p>
        <p>Radiation knows about Ribbons's plans and understands how she feels about Heaven, but being so close to the Aether and having a steady job with decent managers, he doesn't always agree with her. However, he's acutely aware that he has a lot to learn and tries to broaden his horizons every day. He knows he comes from a place of privilege.</p>
