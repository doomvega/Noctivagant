        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>Ribbons was Forged in early Central Heaven, as it was still becoming Central Heaven. She settled into her job nicely, but became disillusioned with Heaven after she saw how her peers were being treated.</p>
        <p>In an act of rebellion, she explored abandoned locations within Heaven, left behind from eons ago. In her contact with humans, she learned that this was called "urbex" on Earth, and adopted the term for herself.</p>
        <p>She met Radiation in Central Heaven outside a small café— not that angels can eat— and they became friends right away. They soon met Lyre and Timekeep, and started urbexing all together. Ribbons mostly looks for proof that more angels like her and her friends exist. Luckily for her, angels are known to be notoriously dedicated notekeepers.</p>
        <h2>The... Stream Angel?</h2>
        <p>Ribbons appears on my streams as the Stream Angel! She's the perfect mascot. When I designed her I was just doodling and playing with concepts I really enjoyed in other characters, but she really took off and came into her own.</p>
        <p>I wasn't sure if she was "me" or if I was "her", and I was nervous giving her a face and things to say, but I am really, really proud of her and her story.</p>
