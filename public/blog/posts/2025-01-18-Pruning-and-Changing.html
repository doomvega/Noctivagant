            <p>The key to having a healthy garden is a process called "deadheading", which is where you identify parts of a plant that are dying and gently remove them. I have done this countless times in my gardens. My mother taught me how to do it. I've always felt bad about it, as if I was hurting the plant by removing dead leaves and flowers and branches. But seeing my plants recover, every time, was worth the worry.</p>

            <p>Once again, I have deleted two of my Neocities sites— <i>Felis Celesti</i> and <i>PAST SELF</i>, both projects I started as a budding webmaster that I simply have not had the time or energy to work on. They were dying flowers. I plucked them away. These things happen, and I have to remind myself time and time again that it's okay. Change is a natural part of life. It will be okay.</p>

            <p>I love making websites, but it can get difficult to maintain so many, especially when they have no audience— including yourself. Noctivagant has been for me, fundamentally, and no one else— though I am grateful that so many other webmasters love it too. I don't want it to sound like I'm trying to negate or invalidate that love. Thank you for loving my work.</p>
      
            <p>I'm going to shift my focus, because I have to in order to survive. In the future, if I'd like to come back to those sites, I will. For now, though, I'm going to work on finishing my Java studies, getting commissions, and honing my webdev skills by working on the sites that make the most sense. Right now, that's Noctivagant, my professional site, the Artist's Resource, and the Testing Range. I still have other sites, of course, and some system members have spaces on Neocities. We are wondering about building our own small blog system, like this one, that can be sorted by tag.</p>

            <h3>And Now I'm Rambling</h3>

            <p>I talked about this on BearBlog, but I didn't put it quite clearly— I think I have too many spaces online. Genuinely. I am not a very extroverted person, and while I do like connecting with folks, I would rather connect with them through excited exchanges about cool websites and code rather than through recommendations made by an algorithm that thinks accounts with enormous following lists are real. (Seriously, Bluesky— you have a bot problem.)</p>

            <p>I like BearBlog, and of course I like Neocities. Mastodon is a good place to find art, but it is also prone to flaws. (You people have <i>got</i> to stop complaining about Bluesky and Windows. I'm on an art-based instance! I can see it from here! Knock it off!) And beyond those three, that's really all that I like. Other social spaces are weird and disconnected for me. I know that YouTube and Bluesky have a lot of potential, and I could grow my audience that way, but those are not spaces I want to be in and I think that's okay.</p>

            <p>I left some other Fedi servers recently, and I'm not feeling much of a loss at all. I was absolutely spreading myself out too thin. Even with PostyBirb, I found myself switching between socials every five minutes— <i>do I have notifications here? Did someone respond to me? How has the timeline been?</i> And so on, and so forth, between <i>multiple</i> sites.</p>

            <p>Personally, we don't need much, hence all the socmed and site pruning. I'm thinking about either upgrading my BearBlog to support the dev, or getting down to it and writing a site that uses a searchable tag system to act as a system blog. I've tried to be public about our plurality before, and I am still incredibly hesitant about it, but I think it would be a good project to write, and we would open-source the code so anyone could use it. Of course, that means learning more JavaScript... but I think that's a good price to pay to move away from other sites that offer no control whatsoever.</p>
      
            <p>I think a lot of us are sad right now. There's a lot going on in the world that is out of our control. But this makes me feel like I have some grip on reality, and I recommend that you do the same. Deadhead your garden. Make room for new ideas to flourish.</p>
