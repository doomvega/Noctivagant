            <p>It's 2026. A new year, a fresh start, and a time for us all to reflect, change, and grow.</p>

            <p>I went through a lot in 2025. On top of all of the political shit, I watched a family member die, I saw my mental health collapse, and I was unemployed for a good portion of it all. But through all of the chaos and all of the grief, I started HRT, moved out, started paying off my debts and made huge progress as an artist. 2025 fucking sucked, man. It was awful. But I'm still alive, and stronger for it. I know what I stand for and what I'll defend.</p>

            <p>In 2026, I will:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be confident and bold in my decisions</li>
                    <li>Be loud, without speaking over others</li>
                    <li>Be myself, my whole and true self, without masking or sacrificing anything for anyone else</li>
                    <li>Allow myself to rest...</li>
                    <li>...but always strive to be a little better than I was yesterday.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>...in terms of more practical goals, I'm going to work out once a week, fight rising fascism here in America, set up my new Cricut machine, and switch my testosterone over to injections because my mustache isn't quite there yet. Oh, and get that DOOM fan EP out. I can't forget about that. I also have a ✨ <i>super secret project</i> ✨ that I'm tinkering with that I'm really hyped about.</p>

            <p>So-- fuck ICE, fuck Nazis, fuck anyone and everyone who lets those things slide under the rug. I'm tired of being worn out and bullied by people who are supposed to be competent leaders. I hope that, for 2026, we see great change.</p>

            <p>You are stronger than you realize. Work hard, punch fascists, make art. I have faith in all of us.</p>
