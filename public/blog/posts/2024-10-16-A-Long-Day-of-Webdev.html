      <p>I didn't think I'd be doing this much work on Noctivagant today! Originally I was just going to write a cute little blog layout, then I realized that I could use this layout for <i>my</i> blog, and I just couldn't resist. So I took a few hours and not only hooked everything up but did a lot of internal work, too. So many things are correctly sorted and organized now. Noctivagant no longer lags out when you visit it! It was lagging because I had an RSS feed pointing to BearBlog on each page, so I just moved that over to its own page. I suppose I could write those updates here... that might be wiser, actually. But I appreciate BearBlog's look and feel a lot.</p>

      <p>Working on my site, even when it gets weird and frustrating, just shows me I love the work involved with webdev. This is the first hobby I've had that I really truly <i>love</i><sup>1</sup>, something that— despite at times being tough— brings me great joy. I have a website! I can share things with other people without having to worry about a CEO making bad decisions or the site going down. I'm in control of all of this and I love it.</p>

      <p>I can't wait to add even more to my site... this is so much fun. I love having a space. (I love that its looks and vibe are set automatically! Shit! That's awesome!)</p>
      
      <p><sup>1:</sup> This isn't to say that my other hobbies <i>don't</i> bring me joy, but I think webdev is the strongest passion, possibly beating out music!</p>
