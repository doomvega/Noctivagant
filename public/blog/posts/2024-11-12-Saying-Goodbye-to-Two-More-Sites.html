      <p>Lately, I've been trying to practice privacy. This is a very odd thing to say, becauseâ€” doesn't everyone practice this? But considering recent events, we decided that it would be safer to remove two of our sites from Neocities. These sites were <i>highly</i> personal <i>and</i> underbaked, and I felt it would be best to lay them to rest. There's a lot I want to talk about that I simply am not comfortable broadcasting through a website. We've turned to nightly journalling and other personal bookkeeping which has had nothing but positive impacts on us.</p>

      <p>I always feel so bad putting a website to rest. These are things I do not want archived (though they are backed up on my GitHub if I change my mind), and of course I am very attached to the sites I build. My websites are creatures to me. I love them dearly and I try to take very good care of them. Sometimes that means removing them from Neocities. It just makes me sad.</p>

      <p>On that note, if you have super personal stuff online, I recommend shifting to an analog approach now. This isn't to say stop blogging, but be wary of what you talk about now more than ever. Back up your sites. Put them in a private GitHub repo. It's so important.</p>

      <p>I will miss those sites. I love you, okay?</p>
