            <p>I don't often talk about myself in a particularly self-indulgent way online, and for the most part I'm fine with that. But the more pushback I see, the more fear and uncertainty the world thrusts upon me, the more I want to finally shed this old Self and be <i>me</i>. So fuck it, I'm going to talk about being transgender.</p>
            <p>I've had a lot of people tell me they couldn't tell what direction I was trans in. Conceptually this is very funny and I like this a lot, but as this past year has gone on, I've started to cock my head at this. Presenting online is easy enough, and I do make myself quite ambiguous. For the most part I think of myself as quite masc-- just with earrings and piercings.</p>
            <p>I think it's time for me to take the leap. I don't have a safety net, you know? I sort of do, with friends that I could probably crash with for a few days at a time, cycling between houses. My job will be good about it. My friends will be good about it. My family won't. I just can't live like this anymore.</p>
            <p>My name is Vega, and sometimes it's Atlas, and sometimes it's Jupiter. Mars, West, Porter. Flynn, John, Josef. You get it.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, I have dreams where I wake up and look in the mirror and I see myself staring back in awe. I touch my scruff and look like that scene from the <i>DOOM</i> movie. Sometimes I have long hair like John Romero, or WayneradioTV. When I speak, my voice is low and powerful, and when I try, I can roar like an animal. The dreams where I roar are the best.</p>
            <p>I did my first pushups ever today. Fifteen, for sleeping in three hours late. I figured five pushups an hour would be enough. Instead of a punishment, I found that I was energized and excited. When I got ready for work, I stopped to admire myself in the mirror. There's little muscle, but I was so <i>happy</i> to see just a little definition in my arms. Chalk that up to working retail and lifting heavy items all day. I'm not on T yet. I'm so excited to be.</p>
            <p>It's going to be hard. It's going to be scary. But so is living as someone I'm not. Whatever happens next, I want to face it head-on.</p>
            <p>I am a man. Not a single soul is going to take that from me.</p>
