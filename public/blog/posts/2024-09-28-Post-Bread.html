      <p>I have made my final "real" post on Cohost. It's sad to see Cohost go, but for its last few days I'm going to do nothing but post bread. I've changed everything. My banner, profile picture, display name— it's all Soldier, having teleported bread for the very last three days of his life. (Of course, if you've seen <a href="https://youtu.be/GLlLQ3LmZWU">Expiration Date,</a> then you know Soldier lives and everyone is fine.) I'm not sure how to cope with the loss of such an important site. Cohost really was one of the best, for everyone there. I can tell you, with confidence, that I will <i>never</i> go back to Tumblr. I live here and on <a href="https://doomvega.bearblog.dev/">my BearBlog</a> now. I figure if I'm going to go out, I'm going to be the <i>funniest motherfucker I can possibly be before I die.</i></p>

      <p>Everything's going to be okay. I believe in us, the Chosties. We're all talented people in our own ways. We're not scattering with nowhere to go. Some of us may have hopped back on sites that we detest, some of us may have made accounts for sites we don't necessarily trust, and some of us might not be returning to social media at all. That's fine. I think that's fine. A lot of us are building websites, gathering RSS feeds, following people on other platforms, making things for the sake of making them. We want to stay connected. We experienced an Internet that I hope one day becomes standard— an Internet that was kind, that had a strong community, that worked to make sure people felt safe. (Yes, there were issues with this on Cohost— but if this had come up on a site like Tumblr <i>nothing would have been done.</i>)</p>
      
      <p>I love Cohost, even through its flaws, and I'm going to miss it for a while.</p>
