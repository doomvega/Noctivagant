      <p>I picked up <i>Balatro</i> very, very early this year on a whim. I wasn't <i>good</i> at it per se, but I was determined, and after a few tries, won my first ever game of <i>Balatro</i>. It was fascinating, and a little scary, and I found myself holding my breath more than once. As a musician I was seriously vibing with the game's soundtrack, as a game developer I was taking notes about how the game reacted to my actions, as a player I just fell head-over-heels for the entire experience. It was tough. It was, at times, brutal. Perfectly planned maneuvers would be interrupted by crafty bosses or silly oversights. But there was not a single time playing <i>Balatro</i> that first night that made me want to quit. Nothing that made me so angry or sad that I had to step away.</p>
      
      <p>As described over on BearBlog, <a href="https://doomvega.bearblog.dev/motion-and-currents/">I've been through a lot the past month</a>; I think all of us have. With the horrors being perpetuated in the American government and instability and uncertainty across the world, it is totally understandable to be broken and scared and needing a place to hide right now. Personally, I lost a close family member. That loss has led me down a road I never anticipated I'd be walking. It's strange, because I'm not the only one grieving, and I have so much to mourn, and every person is grieving differently. So, I turned to the newest game in my library.</p>
      <p>I played <i>Balatro</i> with my father while we were waiting for everyone to come home from the hospital. I turned on Joel's (Vargskelethor) playthrough of the game. While he watched, I listened and played round after round after round. I even showed my grandfather, and‚Äî while he <i>probably</i> didn't get it, he still smiled. Card games are loved between generations, right?</p>

      <p>I played <i>Balatro</i> while my immediate family got together in that old house one last time. We were still chatting like normal. We made fun of the movie that was playing on TV. I won another game that night, maybe two. I was a little too scared to greet Death, and that I am quite ashamed of, but the game helped me stay calm and smile with everyone one more time.</p>

      <p>I played <i>Balatro</i> when I went back to that house over the next few days. It was so quiet in there. <i>Balatro</i> filled the space. I showed my younger cousins, who weren't really into it, but laughed at the idea that I <i>could</i> have lost forty thousand dollars. (I changed chips to dollars in my explanation; I figured that would be easier for them to understand.) It was something I could do. Otherwise, I felt like I was in the way.</p>

      <p>Now, as far as "games I've coped with" goes, this is quite strange. Even I expected myself to dive back deep into <i>DOOM</i>, especially with a new game coming out very soon. I typically get lost in games with a huge, rich story and strong characters, like <i>ULTRAKILL</i> or <i>Fable</i> or‚Äî hold on, sorry, let me check my list‚Äî <i>Tetris</i>. Still, I prefer to play a character, to pretend I'm part of something grander, to save the world or fist-fight angels or‚Äî sorry, I have to check my notes again‚Äî defeat...? Communism? Anyway.</p>

      <p>I'm actually not a fan of card games, especially not <i>digital</i> card games. I have my tastes, which seem to be "boomer shooter but gay, which is all boomer shooters actually" and "just straight up <i>Pok√©mon</i>", which makes <i>Tetris</i> a boomer shooter and <i>DOOM</i> <i>Pok√©mon</i>. So <i>Balatro</i> (which is also <i>Pok√©mon</i>) really, genuinely took me by surprise. I suppose the brain will latch onto anything it can in times of hardship. It is easily one of my favorite games of this year so far, and I predict it will be a huge part of my life going forward, informing my game design and musicianship.</p>
      
      <p>I'm just one of many who have played it, but even still‚Äî thank you for making <i>Balatro</i>. It's one of the greats. üÉèüçå</p>
