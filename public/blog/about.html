        <h1>About the Blog</h1>
        <p>DOOMVEGA's Poasts (title pending) is a Zonelets blog that is hosted on Neocities and maintained by hand by myself, the <a href="/self/about.html">webmaster</a>. I do this for a number of reasons.</p>

        <h2>Social Media Sucks</h2>
        <p>I feel like this is fairly self-explanatory, but seriously: modern social media is genuinely god-awful to use. As someone with an attention disorder, I find it very easy to search endlessly for something new. Instagram, Reddit, Tumblr— it's all the same content, just marketed differently.</p>
        <p>My purpose as a creative is to find solutions to problems, whether elegant or not. And elegant is subjective. Running this blog may not seem elegant to some, but it's so much better than needing to fight for the right to say "dead" or "suicide". It's also much easier to impose my own set of rules, which is that no minors should be here. Go do whatever it is that the kids are doing these days.</p>

        <h2>It's Handmade</h2>
        <p>A huge draw to Tumblr when I was younger was the ability to customize my blog however I wanted. I did not yet read a lick of HTML or CSS and mostly hacked things together, but I loved being able to carve out a portion of the site all to myself!</p>
        <p>But Tumblr has its drawbacks and I've since shifted to posting 100% remotely, only signing in on occasion to clear my notifications and schedule more posts when applicable. I don't need to host this blog there, nor do I want to. I made this myself. Every word I put out here is for me, and whoever else resonates with it. I can make whatever changes I want, whenever I want.</p>
        <p>I think Zonelets is one of the best solutions to blogging on Neocities at the moment. The framework is simple and beautiful and I don't think I'll ever look back.</p>

        <h2>It's Mine</h2>
        <p>Something that really gets me with most social sites now is not just the lack of customization and control, it's the total lack of agency. I don't go on any social site— except Mastodon— and get to "be myself" in any meaningful way. I do their dance, play their games, and lose a portion of myself in the process. I would stop, if I could keep eyes on my art in doing so, but I find that unlikely.</p>
        <p>It's a good project for me to maintain. Whenever I get bored, just pop open VS Code and connect to the repository and type away. Add some headers, some paragraphs, push to Neocities, and the site just updates. I enjoy being able to do that on this website, which is a mish-mash of everything I've learned as a web developer, and everything I love.</p>
        <p>This blog stands as a testament that you can indeed take back agency on the Internet.</p>
