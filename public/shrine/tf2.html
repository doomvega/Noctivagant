        <p>When I was fifteen years old, I met someone through Discord. Their screen name eludes me, but they introduced me to one of my most favorite things— the Team Fortress comics. It was late at night and I was warned that the comics still weren't finished after two years of waiting, but I dove into them anyway. It was instant love. Head-over-heels kind of love. Got up the next day and downloaded the game kind of love. Reading the comics, I had genuinely forgotten about the ending and was shocked when I went to read the next comic and was kicked back to the main page of the Team Fortress site.</p>
        <p>This band of characters was so... odd, and different, and to my Tumblr-poisoned brain they were a break from the idea of "perfection". They were weird! They were awful! They <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/tf01_ring_of_fired/#f=41">snapped people's necks</a> and knew how to <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/tf04_blood_in_the_water/#f=66">bury bodies in the most efficient ways</a> and <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/tf05_old_wounds/#f=64">committed medical malpractice</a> and... they were fucking <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/tf06_thenakedandthedead/#f=256">AWESOME!</a></p>
        <p>I met all sorts of people through Team Fortress and learned about myself, too. I started wearing round glasses like Medic. I briefly went by "Scout" when I figured out I was non-binary. Team Fortress was a comfort for my messy brain and it still is.</p>
        <p>I never played multiplayer matches often but one match stands out to me very clearly— it was soon after I started playing and even though I was a newbie I was determined to be the best Medic for my team. I wound up pocketing a Demoknight who was on voice, talking to me. The guy was so kind the entire time. We had each other's backs for a while before I left. He was awesome.</p>
        <p>Team Fortress is largely responsible for who I am today. I discovered Team Fortress in a really stressful time of my life and it left a huge impact on me.</p>
        <p>S, if you're still out there, thank you, and I hope you're doing well.</p>
