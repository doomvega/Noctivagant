        <p>I didn't think I would like DOOM.</p>
        <p>It just sat there in my Steam library, untouched for roughly a year. In January 2023, I decided that it was time to finally give it a try. I don't know what I expected, really. Maybe a standard first-person shooter with a ton of action. Maybe something mindless that I could tinker with until I got bored of it. What I wasn't expecting was a game and story that had me playing for seven hours straight, with my only break being dinner (it was ramen and it was delicious). Something in me just clicked with this game. I can't explain it. DOOM was made for me and I was made for DOOM.</p>
        <p>Suddenly I was studying everything there was to study with this series. I played classic DOOM for the first time and I felt just as excited and curious as I was playing 2016. I stuggled through Eternal, and though I am bitter about it I loved it too. I watched the DOOM movies from 2005 and 2019 and had a blast, laughing-crying the entire time. I read and shared the <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/124128-doom-the-graphic-novel-a-complete-collection-of-doom-comics-with-wonderful-extras-updated-to-final-version/">DOOM comics</a> I found— both the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/slxE9or">DOOM II RPG comic</a> and, uh... yeah, <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/10years/doomcomic/comic.php">that one.</a></p>
        <p>I watched High Score (narrated by Charles Martinet, he's FANTASTIC in this show) which featured an episode about DOOM (episode six, "Level Up") and introduced me to the legendary John Romero and his team. I knew right away that he was the coolest person on the planet. Plus, he wore scuffed black nail polish for his professional documentary interview, and I loved that. My parents gifted me his autobiography for Christmas of 2023 and I finished reading it in early 2024. Lots of tears were shed reading that book. Just the mention of "Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement" made me so excited I cried. Maybe I'm an easy crier.</p>
        <p>DOOM is a powerful game, with a million powerful messages. None of us are space marines, but we can all fight for the future we deserve— the future we've been denied for so long.</p>
