        <h1>Fable Challenges</h1>
        <div class="sub"><p>A list of special challenges for Fable II!</p></div>
        <p>Fable is a wonderful little series that was created for the Xbox family of consoles and has become somewhat of a cult classic. I have a shrine dedicated to it <a href="/shrine/fable">here</a>. Since Fable is relatively easy to beat once you've played it a couple of times, I came up with some challenges to keep Fable interesting! These lists are mostly for FII, though you can adapt them to FI, FIII, and F:tJ.</p>
        <p>These lists should be used with either a random number generator or dice.</p>

        <h2>Heroic Disciplines:</h2>
            <ol>
            <li><b>One Discipline Only:</b> this challenge forces you to stick with only one Heroic discipline— Strength, Skill, or Will. You must use only one discipline unless in special circumstances, like when the Commandant orders you to take his blade or when Theresa tells you to use your Will to open the Cullis Gate. You will need to reroll to find out what discipline you're going to study.</li>
                <ul>
                <li>If you roll a one or three, you will study Strength.</li>
                <li>If you roll a two or five, you will study Skill.</li>
                <li>If you roll a four or six, you will study Will.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><b>Jack of (all) Trades:</b> this challenge forces you to use each of your disciplines equally. You cannot rely on one discipline to help you, and you must use Strength, Skill, and Will in every fight.</li>
            <li><b>Master of None:</b> in this challenge, you cannot upgrade any of your disciplines. This is similar to the Rusty Weapons run, the difference being that you may upgrade your equipment and gear as needed. You will need to rely heavily on healing items so you don't get knocked out.</li>
            <li><b>All but One:</b> this challenge seems pretty normal, except you are forced to lose one discipline. You can use and upgrade everything else, but you'll be missing one! Use the list above to figure out which discipline you're losing.</li>
            </ol>
        
        <h2>Morality & Purity:</h2>
        <p>You'll have to roll twice for this section— hence why neutral appears in both halves of this list. Purity solely affects how your Hero morphs, and does not necessarily reflect their morality, which can lead to some interesting combinations.</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>Neutral</li>
            <li>Evil</li>
            </ol>

            <ol>
            <li>Pure</li>
            <li>Neutral</li>
            <li>Corrupt</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Playstyles:</h2>
            <ol>
            <li><b>Nuzlocke:</b> this challenge is exactly what it sounds like. In this run, any knock-outs are permanent— meaning that if you go down in battle, even in places like the Crucible, you're down forever and you must restart the run from the very beginning. You may use healing items like food and potions, but Ressurection Phials are prohibited! The exceptions to this run are if you are shocked in the Spire and when Lucien shoots you on Hero Hill.</li>
            <li><b>Fixed Weapons:</b> this challenge forces you to stay with a certain kind of weapon throughout your playthrough. For example, you may get stuck using only hammers and pistols. You may upgrade to higher weapon tiers, but you must stick with these weapon types throughout the game. Please roll for each discipline (or just one, if you're doing the One Discipline challenge).</li>

                </div>

            <li><b>Main Quest ONLY:</b> this challenge forces you to spread your renown in interesting ways. You cannot do sidequests to gain renown which means you'll be commissioning statues and showing off trophies to Albionites across the country! Be aware that this also means that locations like Brightwood and Oakfield will be altered if you do this challenge, so be prepared.</li>
            <li><b>Completionist:</b> I hope you have a lot of spare time on your hands, because you'll be collecting everything in this run, and I mean everything. Every weapon at every possible tier, including special weapons like the Daichi and the Hammerthyst, every item of clothing, every dye, every miscellaneous item and gift, every book, every emote, and you'll have to do every sidequest (disregarding quests that follow the same storyline but are separated by morality, such as the Farmer Giles questline). On top of that, you'll have to open every chest, find every silver key, and dig up every treasure. You get the picture.</li>
            <li><b>Potionholic:</b> in this challenge, you can only gain experience from potions. All experience that drops from enemies must be ignored. If you'd like to level up in a certain discipline, you'd better have some extra cash on hand!</li>
            <li><b>Potionholics Anonymous:</b> in this challenge, you cannot use healing items such as potions and food. This is similar to a Nuzlocke, but you're relatively okay if you get knocked out— however, be aware, you could be losing a lot of experience, which will slow you down.</li>
            <li><b>It's Dangerous to go Alone, Take This!:</b> this challenge forces you to use weapons that are gifted to you or that you discover in chests or dig spots. Each time you find a new weapon, you MUST use it, and effectively retire the one that came before it— yes, even if it's worse than the last.</li>
            <li><b>Rusty Weapons:</b> this challenge requires that you stick with your rusty weapons and level one spell of your choice throughout the entire game. You will die, a LOT. You can upgrade your disciplines, but not Toughness. To make this challenge even harder, don't upgrade your disciplines whatsoever! Healing items are highly recommended.</li>
            <li><b>Every Last Drop:</b> in this challenge, you're required to get every single drop of experience. Yep, every single one. The game actually stops you automatically when you've collected all the experience in the area, and a lot of it clips through the floor but can be brought back up if you're patient enough. Do not get knocked out!— at least, not before you've soaked up everything you can.</li>
            <li><b>Wait, This Isn't Another Undertale™ Reference, is it?:</b> if your alignment wound up being good, then you must be a pacifist. This means you must spare as many people— enemies and other Albionites alike— as possible. On the flip side, if your alignment wound up being evil, you must harm everyone that crosses your path, and leave Albion a husk of what it once was.</li>
