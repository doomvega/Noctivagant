        <p>Fable was one of the first games I ever played. Sure, I'd played other games before, but nothing captured me like Fable did. Even when I was very young, Albion had some sort of magic over me, and I always wanted to play. And while they gave me nightmares when I was young, I deeply appreciate how varied, rich, and real these games can get.</p>
        <p>Fable was created by the now defunct Lionhead Studios, led by the infamous Peter Molyneux. Of all the games Lionhead made, Fable was perhaps their most popular. While they were still afloat, Lionhead produced Fable I, II, and III, then Microsoft continued the series when they couldn't go on. Fable: the Journey and Fable: Legends were created with Microsoft's input, neither of which did as well as their predecessors— Legends did so poorly, in fact, that barely anyone actually got to play it, as Microsoft took it down and shut down its servers.</p>
        <p>However, each Fable game holds a special place in my heart. I started with Fable II, so it will always be my favorite, but III and F:tJ are close seconds.</p>
        <p>I have a special page on challenges for Fable II <a href="/creations/fablechallenges">here</a>.</p>
