        <p>Like so many others in the early 2010s, I was fascinated by Minecraft. My father had access to very early builds of the game, which means I've been playing since 2011. One of my first memories with the game was watching my father build a dirt tower to escape some skeletons. I could paint that moment if I wanted; it is perfectly captured in my brain. I was so young at the time that I didn't really grasp how revolutionary it was.</p>
        <p>I never played with mods, and I didn't really like servers. I wasn't allowed to use either growing up. So, my early Minecraft days were lonely and plain. But that didn't stop me from escaping.</p>
        <p>Growing up in a stressful home means that games like Minecraft are prefect for a few hours of escapism. Minecraft was near and dear to me as a kid because it was so <i>quiet.</i> Plenty of other games I played involved combat, or a storyline, or quests, and while those are great, sometimes what I needed was to carve out the Earth for a few hours. Just me and my iron pick, hollowing out the world.</p>
        <p>There are worlds I remember so vividly, and worlds I have largely forgotten. There are worlds I've been maintaining since middle school, and worlds I just started last week. I'm allowed to pop in, check on things, and leave. Time stops when I am not there. I don't have to slog through a mission if I want to save and quit (looking at <i>you,</i> DOOM Eternal). I don't have to do any quests. I set goals for myself and do what I can to get there.</p>
        <p>Now that I'm an adult, I play Minecraft a little differently. Of course, with my own PC, I run mods and check in on servers once in a while. I don't play on Peaceful anymore because I appreciate the gameplay loop that you get with monsters. There is now a risk for working late, for tripping and falling into a cave, for entering the Nether unprepared. I finally beat the game without cheating to get there. I spend my time making beautiful structures and farms, essentially playing 3D Stardew Valley. But what sets Minecraft apart from all the other games I've ever played is that <i>you, as a player, are allowed to play the game however you want.</i></p>
        <p>No other game I have ever played allows you to do this. You are confined within the rules of the world, perhaps within the rules of the engine, the rules of the gameplay. But Minecraft's gameplay is break blocks, place blocks, craft tools, hit mobs. (Of course, there's much more to it than this, but completely simplified it is this.) Having such a broad set of rules allows the player to play however they feel like, and I believe this contributed to the Minecraft modding scene in a big way. Do you want to be a farmer in the open plains? You can do that. Do you want to settle in and be a part of a village? You can do that. Do you want to declare yourself king of the world and build a giant castle to prove it? <i>You can do that.</i> There is nothing stopping you from doing <i>whatever you want</i>.</p>
        <p>Despite my disagreeing with what Mojang has added to the game (did we <i>need</i> turtles or foxes or the Warden or those underwater temples (underwater monk)? That's another essay), Minecraft is easily one of my favorite games because it can be whatever you need it to be. It's not called Virtual Lego for no reason.</p>
