        <h2><i>Doomguy: Life in First Person</i> by John Romero</h2>
        <div class="bookbox"><img src="/images/books/doomguy.png"></div>
        <p>I got this book as a Christmas gift in 2023. I tore through it throughout the end of December and into January. I don't quite know how or why, and deep down I don't wish to know how or why, but the things Romero described experiencing, all throughout his life, line up with the things I've lived through. Rough childhood? Financial instability? Northern New England? I've been there, too. So much that he talked about brought me to tears because it resonated with me so strongly (that and I'm very passionate about iD games).</p>
        <p>Romero describes his life in near-perfect detail. Every feeling, every event, every victory and every loss is preserved in this book. Even if you're not into <i>any</i> of the iD games, Romero's autobiography is just incredible. I sincerely recommend it and hope that you find joy in it, too.</p>

        <h2><i>Blood, Sweat, and Pixels</i> by Jason Schreier</h2>
        <div class="bookbox2"><img src="/images/books/bloodsweatandpixels.jpg"></div>
        <p>I picked up this book at my local used games store. It took me a while to come around and read it, but I'm very glad I did. It's a collection of stories about how various video games were made. One that stood out to me in particular was the story of <i>Stardew Valley</i>, despite the fact I already knew how it was made. Eric Barone is a very dedicated guy, and I see that in myself at times. I also appreciated the story of <i>Shovel Knight</i>, a game that for far too long I confused with <i>Castle Crashers</i>. I loved each story, how despite the odds the developers succeeded, and where they failed, how they recovered.</p>
        <p>Schreier takes a peek into the world of game development, from AAA to indie hits, and shows his audience that game development isn't as glamorous or easy as it seems. It's an important thing to remember in a world where "Computers just seem so simple and easy, and the technology is evolving, so why aren't the games absolutely perfect?"</p>
        <p>There are entire swaths of people being pushed through the horrible, unforgiving machine that is corporate games development, and they're human, and they're doing their best. There are thousands of people who lock themselves away to focus on their little indie title, which might not even succeed. People who bet on their passions, on their hopes, on their dreams. Sometimes they win, sometimes they lose. That's the reality of it.</p>

        <h2><i>Lost in a Good Game</i> by Pete Etchells</h2>
        <div class="bookbox"><img src="/images/books/lostinagoodgame.jpg"></div>
        <p>I am by no means any sort of psychologist. I have never studied the brain and I don't think it's something that's in the cards for me. However, I <i>am</i> a game developer, and I am a big fan of particularly violent games like <i>Skyrim</i>, <i>DOOM</i>, and <i>ULTRAKILL</i>. I'm no stranger to the "video games are evil" argument, and I've seen parts of the 1990s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993%E2%80%9394_United_States_Senate_hearings_on_video_games">senate hearings on video game violence</a>. Etchells takes a deep dive into these arguments, among other topics such as video games preservation and the impacts of screentime on young folks.</p>
        <p>Because I am not a psychologist, it's refreshing to hear someone within the field discuss and dissect these issues surrounding games. It's upsetting and at times uncomfortable to be a fan of any sort of video games when a loud minority are convinced that they are making people into violent monsters. Knowing that there's research and people like Etchells actively looking to find answers regarding these issues is important to me, and I'm sure many others.</p>

        <h2><i>Rise of the Videogame Zinesters</i> by Anna Anthropy</h2>
        <div class="bookbox2"><img src="/images/books/zinesters.webp"></div>
        <p>I found <i>Rise of the Videogame Zinesters</i> in my local used games shop, sitting in the small library section they have that's usually filled with game guides or books of cheats for games that are old enough to have a spouse and children. The cover drew me in, and the tagline caught my eye; how <i>were</i> people making video games? Why? I snagged it, hoping to tear through it like I usually do with any book. But life happened, and it sat in my room for a very long time, horrifically unread. I needed a break from <i>The Body Keeps the Score</i>, so I picked it up again.</p>
        <p>Inside were messages that I'd been hearing for a while, messages that I'd only just <i>listened</i> to recently. An attitude that reminded me of the best and queerest of Cohost, and the passion that comes with making games. Anthropy's discussion of games felt familiar and welcoming. I found myself trying <i>so hard</i> not to read the book in one sitting. I got about halfway through before I decided to just go for it. There was one section that really resonated with me, more so than anything else: Anthropy lists topics to make games about. It seems so silly, but she argues that you can— and <i>should</i>— make games about anything and everything. It made me very hopeful for the future of games.</p>
