                <p>Timekeep is the "oldest" of the bunch, having been Forged long before Ribbons or even Radiation. As such, it is the most experienced, so the others often turn to it for wisdom or ideas. It acts mostly as a guardian and caretaker, often trying to guide its friends in the right direction-- especially Ribbons.</p>
                <p>It took to Lyre after it observed her struggling to interact with other angels. The two became friends, though they rarely have anything to say to each other. They do not live together, as that is forbidden, but they live close to each other, so they spend time together often.</p>
                <p>In the face of the revolution, Timekeep remains stoic. It refuses to comment on it, and if it does have anything to say, it's not necessarily positive. But deep down, Timekeep knows that this is necessary. It has observed the corruption of Heaven throughout its life and wants to put a stop to it.</p>
