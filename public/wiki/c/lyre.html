                <p>Though angels are ageless, Lyre was Forged much sooner than Ribbons, Radiation or Timekeep, making Lyre the baby of the bunch. She is soft-spoken and shy, opting to follow the rules to a T. Because she's so quiet, she tends to stay with Timekeep, as it is her guardian and at times, her voice.</p>
                <p>She met Ribbons one day after another angel suggested that Lyre's work was subpar, and joked that she should be Cast. Ribbons stood up for her then and has looked out for her ever since.</p>
                <p>Lyre tries her best to be brave in the face of a revolution. It's difficult, but she hopes that things will get better after it's all over.</p>
