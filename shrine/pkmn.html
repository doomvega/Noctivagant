        <p>I first played Pokémon when I was about seven years old. I was super young and had no clue what I was doing, really. I remember choosing Oshawott by accident— I don't recall who I wanted to choose instead, but I do remember thinking that I had made a mistake. Despite this, choosing Oshawott changed my life. The first Gym Leader I challenged was Cilan, who gave me a lot of trouble (mostly because I hadn't figured out type matchups then), and showed me that this game wasn't as easy as I thought it was. As I played, Oshawott grew alongside me, which I found super cool. Samurott carried me through a lot of battles, mostly the end-game stuff. I remember challenging the Elite Four for the first time and finding out I outleveled Zekrom. I miss it, it was a ton of fun.</p>
        <p>Now I have a new save file on White, and I'm dedicated to collecting <a href="https://noctivagant.neocities.org/creations/allpkmngames">every Pokémon game there is</a>! There are plenty of dark times that i probably wouldn't have survived without Pokémon. I sincerely feel that I would be a starkly different person if I hadn't received that hand-me-down copy of White.</p>
        <p>Once I collect and/or make some more fanworks surrounding Pokémon, I'll happily upload links to them here.</p>
