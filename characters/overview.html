        <div class="sub"><p>All of my little guys...</p></div>
        <p>Many artists have a place to store all their characters, whether that's in a document, a notebook, or a site like Toyhouse. I realized that I didn't have something like that, so here we are! A little directory of all my characters, for reference and safekeeping.</p>
        <p>Each of their names is a hyperlink to their own pages.</p>
        <div class="sub"><p><a href="/characters/ribbons">Unless you'd like to cycle through each page one-by-one?</a></p></div>
        
        <h2>HEAVENSPEAK</h2>
        <!-- <p><b>NAME:</b> text text text text text</p> -->
        <p><b><a href="/characters/ribbons">Ribbons:</a></b> perhaps the most recognizable of the bunch, Ribbons appears on all my livestreams and is in charge of leading a Heavenly revolution off-camera.</p>
        <p><b><a href="/characters/radiation">Radiation:</a></b> Ribbons's closest friend, Radiation tags along wherever Ribbons goes. He's constantly trapped in this battle of "what is legal" and "what is moral" during Ribbons's revolution ordeal.</p>
        <p><b><a href="/characters/lyre">Lyre:</a></b> quiet and observant. Lyre barely speaks above a whisper and appreciates guidance from Timekeep and the rest of her friends.</p>
        <p><b><a href="/characters/timekeep">Timekeep:</a></b> strong, but very quiet like Lyre. When it speaks, it speaks for a reason. It has a dry, well-aged sense of humor, like a fine wine (but would it approve of that joke? I literally invented it, I should know!).</p>
        
        <h2>Pokémon</h2>
        <p><b>Symi:</b> my Pokésona (still up for debate). Just a Simisage who hangs out in Pinwheel Forest.</p>
        <p><b>Basil:</b> a Grass-type Samurott. Curious yet fierce. His tail is a big leaf!</p>
        <p><b>Elwen:</b> a Lilligant-Delphox (Lillifox) fusion. They like to dance and garden.</p>
        
        <h2>Fursonas & Furries</h2>
        <p><b>Fursona:</b> my oldest fursona who no longer has a name. They're never seen without their scarf.</p>
        <p><b>Borealis:</b> an Arctic fox who was granted the beauty of the Aurora Borealis. He struggles with complicated emotions at times.</p>
        <p><b>Jupiter:</b> a space wizard with a cool staff and wings. Jupiter is all about astronomy and knows the secrets of the stars.</p>
        
        <h2>Dungeons & Dragons</h2>
        <p><b>Lorcán:</b> a Foxfolk pirate who's lost his way.</p>
