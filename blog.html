    <h1 id="6">Pruning & Changing</h1>
    <p>The key to having a healthy garden is a process called "deadheading", which is where you identify parts of a plant that are dying and gently remove them. I have done this countless times in my gardens. My mother taught me how to do it. I've always felt bad about it, as if I was hurting the plant by removing dead leaves and flowers and branches. But seeing my plants recover, every time, was worth the worry.</p>
    <p>Once again, I have deleted two of my Neocities sites‚Äî <i>Felis Celesti</i> and <i>PAST SELF</i>, both projects I started as a budding webmaster that I simply have not had the time or energy to work on. They were dying flowers. I plucked them away. These things happen, and I have to remind myself time and time again that it's okay. Change is a natural part of life. It will be okay.</p>
    <p>I love making websites, but it can get difficult to maintain so many, especially when they have no audience‚Äî including yourself. Noctivagant has been for me, fundamentally, and no one else‚Äî though I am grateful that so many other webmasters love it too. I don't want it to sound like I'm trying to negate or invalidate that love. Thank you for loving my work.</p>
    <p>I'm going to shift my focus, because I have to in order to survive. In the future, if I'd like to come back to those sites, I will. For now, though, I'm going to work on finishing my Java studies, getting commissions, and honing my webdev skills by working on the sites that make the most sense. Right now, that's Noctivagant, my professional site, the Artist's Resource, and the Testing Range. I still have other sites, of course, and some system members have spaces on Neocities. We are wondering about building our own small blog system, like this one, that can be sorted by tag.</p>
    <h3>And Now I'm Rambling</h3>
    <p>I talked about this on BearBlog, but I didn't put it quite clearly‚Äî I think I have too many spaces online. Genuinely. I am not a very extroverted person, and while I do like connecting with folks, I would rather connect with them through excited exchanges about cool websites and code rather than through recommendations made by an algorithm that thinks accounts with enormous following lists are real. (Seriously, Bluesky‚Äî you have a bot problem.)</p>
    <p>I like BearBlog, and of course I like Neocities. Mastodon is a good place to find art, but it is also prone to flaws. (You people have <i>got</i> to stop complaining about Bluesky and Windows. I'm on an art-based instance! I can see it from here! Knock it off!) And beyond those three, that's really all that I like. Other social spaces are weird and disconnected for me. I know that YouTube and Bluesky have a lot of potential, and I could grow my audience that way, but those are not spaces I want to be in and I think that's okay.</p>
    <p>I left some other Fedi servers recently, and I'm not feeling much of a loss at all. I was absolutely spreading myself out too thin. Even with PostyBirb, I found myself switching between socials every five minutes‚Äî <i>do I have notifications here? Did someone respond to me? How has the timeline been?</i> And so on, and so forth, between <i>multiple</i> sites.</p>
    <p>Personally, we don't need much, hence all the socmed and site pruning. I'm thinking about either upgrading my BearBlog to support the dev, or getting down to it and writing a site that uses a searchable tag system to act as a system blog. I've tried to be public about our plurality before, and I am still incredibly hesitant about it, but I think it would be a good project to write, and we would open-source the code so anyone could use it. Of course, that means learning more JavaScript... but I think that's a good price to pay to move away from other sites that offer no control whatsoever.</p>
    <p>I think a lot of us are sad right now. There's a lot going on in the world that is out of our control. But this makes me feel like I have some grip on reality, and I recommend that you do the same. Deadhead your garden. Make room for new ideas to flourish.</p>

    <h1 id="5">Saying Goodbye to two More Sites</h1>
    <p>Lately, I've been trying to practice privacy. This is a very odd thing to say, because‚Äî doesn't everyone practice this? But considering recent events, we decided that it would be safer to remove two of our sites from Neocities. These sites were <i>highly</i> personal <i>and</i> underbaked, and I felt it would be best to lay them to rest. There's a lot I want to talk about that I simply am not comfortable broadcasting through a website. We've turned to nightly journalling and other personal bookkeeping which has had nothing but positive impacts on us.</p>
    <p>I always feel so bad putting a website to rest. These are things I do not want archived (though they are backed up on my GitHub if I change my mind), and of course I am very attached to the sites I build. My websites are creatures to me. I love them dearly and I try to take very good care of them. Sometimes that means removing them from Neocities. It just makes me sad.</p>
    <p>On that note, if you have super personal stuff online, I recommend shifting to an analog approach now. This isn't to say stop blogging, but be wary of what you talk about now more than ever. Back up your sites. Put them in a private GitHub repo. It's so important.</p>
    <p>I will miss those sites. I love you, okay?</p>

    <h1 id="4">A Long Day of Webdev</h1>
    <p>I didn't think I'd be doing this much work on Noctivagant today! Originally I was just going to write a cute little blog layout, then I realized that I could use this layout for <i>my</i> blog, and I just couldn't resist. So I took a few hours and not only hooked everything up but did a lot of internal work, too. So many things are correctly sorted and organized now. Noctivagant no longer lags out when you visit it! It was lagging because I had an RSS feed pointing to BearBlog on each page, so I just moved that over to its own page. I suppose I could write those updates here... that might be wiser, actually. But I appreciate BearBlog's look and feel a lot.</p>
    <p>Working on my site, even when it gets weird and frustrating, just shows me I love the work involved with webdev. This is the first hobby I've had that I really truly <i>love</i><sup>1</sup>, something that‚Äî despite at times being tough‚Äî brings me great joy. I have a website! I can share things with other people without having to worry about a CEO making bad decisions or the site going down. I'm in control of all of this and I love it.</p>
    <p>I can't wait to add even more to my site... this is so much fun. I love having a space. (I love that its looks and vibe are set automatically! Shit! That's awesome!)</p>
    <p><sup>1:</sup> This isn't to say that my other hobbies <i>don't</i> bring me joy, but I think webdev is the strongest passion, possibly beating out music!</p>

    <h1 id="3">Post Bread.</h1>
    <p>I have made my final "real" post on Cohost. It's sad to see Cohost go, but for its last few days I'm going to do nothing but post bread. I've changed everything. My banner, profile picture, display name‚Äî it's all Soldier, having teleported bread for the very last three days of his life. (Of course, if you've seen <a href="https://youtu.be/GLlLQ3LmZWU">Expiration Date,</a> then you know Soldier lives and everyone is fine.) I'm not sure how to cope with the loss of such an important site. Cohost really was one of the best, for everyone there. I can tell you, with confidence, that I will <i>never</i> go back to Tumblr. I live here and on <a href="https://doomvega.bearblog.dev/">my BearBlog</a> now. I figure if I'm going to go out, I'm going to be the <i>funniest motherfucker I can possibly be before I die.</i></p>
    <p>Everything's going to be okay. I believe in us, the Chosties. We're all talented people in our own ways. We're not scattering with nowhere to go. Some of us may have hopped back on sites that we detest, some of us may have made accounts for sites we don't necessarily trust, and some of us might not be returning to social media at all. That's fine. I think that's fine. A lot of us are building websites, gathering RSS feeds, following people on other platforms, making things for the sake of making them. We want to stay connected. We experienced an Internet that I hope one day becomes standard‚Äî an Internet that was kind, that had a strong community, that worked to make sure people felt safe. (Yes, there were issues with this on Cohost‚Äî but if this had come up on a site like Tumblr <i>nothing would have been done.</i>)</p>
    <p>I love Cohost, even through its flaws, and I'm going to miss it for a while.</p>
